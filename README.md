##Brain Tumor Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Introduction
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the classification of brain tumors from MRI images. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and classify different types of brain tumors. This is crucial for assisting medical professionals in the early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors, which can significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient prognosis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is composed of MRI images of brain tumors, categorized into different classes. The images are divided into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation. The dataset is stored in the following directory structure:


/DataSets-ML
    /train
        /class1
        /class2
        ...
    /test
        /class1
        /class2
        ...
    /validation
        /class1
        /class2
        ...
